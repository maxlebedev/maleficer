Maleficer is a Berlin definition rogulike which takes inspiration from tactics games.
The combat of many rogulikes boils down to walking into enemies until they die, and I'm aiming to replace that with a more rich experiance.
I also take inspiration from modern TTRPGs like Trespassor, especially in terms of mechanical clarity.

# Plot
The player is an ambitous and foolhardy wizard school dropout. He starts with some default spells, but learns many more via exploration.


# Spells

## Mechanical Ideas
	- teleportation/forced movement
	- info gathering (bigger sight radius, heartbeat counter)
	- terrain generation (creat new hallways)
	- resouce exchange (health for mana etc)

## Resource Ideas
	- Like MTG: 5 different kinds of mana, with some mechanical niche protection
	- Stats: a stat for magic reserves, magnitude, duration, AOE size/range, etc

# Design Questions
	- Why explore the level, (vs doing down asap)
	- What is the progression system?
